# Installing Python on Mac: Step-by-Step Guide

Here's how to install Python on your Mac:

## 1. Check if Python is already installed
Open Terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal) and type:
```
python3 --version
```

If you see a version number (like "Python 3.x.x"), Python is already installed.

## 2. Choose an installation method
I recommend using either Homebrew (package manager) or the official installer.

### Option A: Using Homebrew (Recommended)
1. Install Homebrew first if you don't have it:
   ```
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. Install Python:
   ```
   brew install python
   ```

### Option B: Using the official installer
1. Visit the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/
2. Click "Download Python 3.x.x" (latest stable version)
3. Open the downloaded .pkg file
4. Follow the installation wizard

## 3. Verify the installation
After installation is complete, open Terminal and type:
```
python3 --version
```

You should see the version number of your newly installed Python.

## 4. Set up your PATH (if needed)
If typing `python3` doesn't work after installation:

1. Open your shell profile:
   ```
   nano ~/.zshrc   # For newer Macs using zsh
   ```
   or
   ```
   nano ~/.bash_profile   # For older Macs using bash
   ```

2. Add this line to the file:
   ```
   export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
   ```

3. Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X)
4. Reload your profile:
   ```
   source ~/.zshrc   # For zsh
   ```
   or
   ```
   source ~/.bash_profile   # For bash
   ```

## 5. Install pip (if not included)
Most Python installations include pip, but you can check:
```
pip3 --version
```

If not installed:
```
python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
```
